      <p>
        Cubism was a revolutionary new approach to representing reality invented in around 1907–08 by artists Pablo
        Picasso and Georges Braque. They brought different views of subjects (usually objects or figures) together in
        the same picture, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented and abstracted. Pablo Picasso.<br>
